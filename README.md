# menu-app

Before using this app, you should put all your supplies (products you already have at home) in Supplies.txt and all your recipes in RecipeBook.txt.
This must be done by strictly following the examples of the existing files - Supplies.txt and RecipeBook.txt, otherwise it won't work.

Menu making app has 3 different options:
1. You can choose freely from the recipes in the recipe book, then it looks at the supplies that you already have and gives you a list of products to buy;
2. If you're too lazy to choose the recipes by yourself, you can get a random menu, based on the types of dishes you will want to eat;
3. If you're at home and don't feel like shopping, you can get recipes you can make now from the products from supplies.

Free bugs included.
Enjoy!
